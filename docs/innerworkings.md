# Inner Workings of the RAG Vector Search Repository

## Data Processing

1. **Dataset Loading**:
   - The dataset is loaded using the `datasets` library from Hugging Face.
   - It contains news headlines and short descriptions, which are combined for embedding.

2. **Text Embedding**:
   - We use a pre-trained model (`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) to convert the text into vector embeddings.
   - The embeddings are stored in a NumPy array and saved for further use.

## Vector Search with Milvus

1. **Milvus Setup**:
   - Milvus is used as a vector database to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently.
   - The embeddings are inserted into Milvus, indexed, and made available for fast vector searches.

2. **Indexing**:
   - The embeddings are indexed using the IVF_FLAT index type with the L2 metric, which allows for efficient retrieval based on vector similarity.

## RAG Pipeline

1. **Integration**:
   - The RAG pipeline integrates the vector search capabilities of Milvus with the text generation capabilities of a language model (OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3).
   - The pipeline handles queries by retrieving relevant embeddings and using them as context for text generation.

2. **Response Generation**:
   - The retrieved vectors provide context to the language model, which then generates a response that is both relevant and informative based on the query.

## UI Interaction

1. **Flask Application**:
   - The Flask app provides a simple interface for users to interact with the RAG pipeline.
   - Users can submit queries and receive responses generated by the pipeline.

2. **HTML Template**:
   - The app uses a basic HTML form (`index.html`) to collect user input and display the generated responses.

## Conclusion

This repository demonstrates the power of combining vector search with language models to create sophisticated information retrieval systems. It is designed to be modular and easily extensible for further development.
